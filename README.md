# Simple Chat
Basic real-time chat application built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.io.
Fun to try out with friends connected to the same server or network.

## Requirements
* Node.js (typically comes with its package manager(`npm`)).
## Local usage
* Clone the repository
* Switch to the project directory
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`
* Open the browser to http://localhost:3000 to view the chat interface.
* Open a new window of your browser to http://localhost:3000 to connect to the chat room as a different user to try out the real-time communication. By default, it is more fun when another human is on the other end. :)

## Demo


Happy chatting!
